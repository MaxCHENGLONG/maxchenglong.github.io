I'm a second-year graduate student from [the Department of Information Technology](https://www2.it.uu.se/itwiki.php?page=first&action=browse&lang=en), [at Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/). My major is Machine Learning and Statistics.

I am seeking to pursue a PhD position starting in Fall 2025, my research interests in machine learning on graphs and machine learning theory.
