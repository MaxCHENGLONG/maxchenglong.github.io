## PROJECTS & RESEARCH <br>
**Mitigating Representation Bias in Extremely Imbalanced Data via BM-GAN**   <br>
Master Thesis – Uppsala University | January 2025 – June 2025 <br>
- Generated targeted synthetic samples with a conditional BM-GAN, strengthening minority-class representation.   <br>
- Benchmarked 10 oversampling/generative methods (e.g., SMOTE, cGAN) on 3 datasets, evaluating NB/k-NN/SVM/CNN classifiers.   <br>
- Built a validation framework to quantify classification robustness and synthetic-data utility.   <br>

**Studying Local and Global Loss Landscapes in Federated Learning**  <br>
Course Project – Uppsala University | September 2024 – January 2025 <br>
- Implemented FedNet/ResNet pipelines with FedAvg & FedAdam across varying client counts and IID/non-IID splits.   <br>
- Applied path-norm analysis showing FedAvg’s lower variance and greater stability under heterogeneous data.   <br>
- Discovered five-client non-IID training on CIFAR-10 improved generalization over two-client baselines.   <br>

**Prediction of Financial Trends via Time-Series Models**   <br>
Bachelor Thesis – Shandong University of Finance and Economics | December 2022 – June 2023 <br>
- Proposed an attention-enhanced LSTM cutting forecasting error by 12–18 % versus vanilla LSTM.   <br>
- Ran 50 + experiments (MAE/MSE/RMSE), achieving 0.055–0.077 error after normalization and window tuning.   <br>
- Analysed volatility regimes, finding 30 %+ accuracy drops during shocks that guided model refinements.   <br>

## EXPERIENCE <br>
**President – ACM Student Society, Shandong University of Finance and Economics**   <br>
September 2020 – June 2021, Jinan, China <br>
- Recruited members and organised 10 + workshops/contests on data-structures and algorithms.   <br>
- Maintained the university Online Judge platform, delivering updates and debugging support.   <br>
- Ran weekly ACM-ICPC training in dynamic programming, graph theory, and related topics.   <br>
